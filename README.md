**Fretmachine** is an interactive guitar neck that I designed for learning music theory on the guitar. For this implementation, I deployed the tool in a custom **WordPress** site, using **JavaScript** to define the functionality for the neck.

The meat-and-potatoes code for the neck functionality is baked into these files:
- **[fretMachine.js](wp-content/themes/accesspress-staple/js/fretMachine.js)**
- **[fretMachine_createScaleFunctions.js](wp-content/themes/accesspress-staple/js/fretMachine_createScaleFunctions.js)**
- **[fretMachine_data.js](wp-content/themes/accesspress-staple/js/fretMachine_data.js)**
- **[fretMachine_dropMenus.js](wp-content/themes/accesspress-staple/js/fretMachine_dropMenus.js)**

You may try out the tool **[here](http://fretmachine.com/fret-machine/)**.

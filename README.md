#fretmachine

Fretmachine is an interactive guitar neck that I designed for learning music theory on the guitar. For this implementation, I deployed the tool in a custom WordPress site, using JavaScript to define the functionality for the neck.

The meat and potatoes code for the neck functionality is baked into these files:
**fretMachine.js**
**fretMachine_createScaleFunctions.js**
**fretMachine_data.js**
**fretMachine_dropMenus.js**

You may visit the site at **[fretmachine.com](http://fretmachine.com)**.

Feel free to drop me a line from the site's 'contact' page if you have any feedback or suggestions on how to improve the site.
